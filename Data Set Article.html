<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>I have a regular requirement for passing data between components and I became bored with re-writting what is essentially the same thing thing and again.  So I decided on a simple data structure that can be used in all the cases.

<H2>Background</H2>

<P>There are many data structures available - XML, JSON &amph; YAML to name a few - 

<H2>Using the code</H2>

<P>A brief description of how to use the article or code. The
	class names, the methods and properties, any tricks or tips.

<P>Blocks of code should be set as style "Formatted" like this:

<pre>//
// Any source code blocks look like this
//</pre>

<P>Remember to set the Language of your code snippet using the Language dropdown.
<P>Use the "var" button to to wrap Variable or class names in &lt;code&ft; tags like <code>this</code>.

<H2>Points of Interest</H2>

<P>Did you learn anything interesting/fun/annoying while writing the code? Did you do anything particularly clever or wild or zany?

<H2>History</H2>

<P>Keep a running update of any changes or improvements you've made here.
